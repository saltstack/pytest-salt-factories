Several improvements to reduce failure points:

* Log the exception instead of raising it.
* Always populate the `*_dirs` config settings, regardless of how salt-factories is being used
* Improved the connect/disconnect behavior of the event listener client
* The minimum supported Salt version is now 3005.0
* The minimum supported Pytest version is now 7.0.0

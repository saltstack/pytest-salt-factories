Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Updated documentation for SaltEnv temp_file and added an example usage (`#163 <https://github.com/saltstack/pytest-salt-factories/issues/163>`_)

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed Salt's deferred imports to allow onedir builds while not breaking non-onedir builds:

  * Additionally, stopped relying on `salt.utils.files` and `salt.utils.yaml`
  * Stopped using `zmq` to forward events(this was where the breakage was showing) for a plain TCP implementation.
  * The `event_listener` fixture is now started/stopped like a regular pytest fixture
  * The `event_listener` server now restarts in case something goes wrong to the point where it crashes. (`#146 <https://github.com/saltstack/pytest-salt-factories/issues/146>`_)

Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Update the github actions versions to avoid deprecation errors (`#145 <https://github.com/saltstack/pytest-salt-factories/issues/145>`_)


1.0.0rc21 (2022-11-04)

Improvements
------------

- Several improvements to the state module wrappers:

  * Allow getting the state chunk by `__id__` on MultiStateResult
  * Wrap a few more functions from `salt.modules.state` (`#140 <https://github.com/saltstack/pytest-salt-factories/issues/140>`_)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Pipeline and requirements fixes:

  * Test against 3005.* and not 3005rc2 since it's now released.
  * Install `importlib-metadata<5.0.0` since only Salt>=3006 will be able to handle it (`#140 <https://github.com/saltstack/pytest-salt-factories/issues/140>`_)


1.0.0rc20 (2022-08-25)

1.0.0rc19 (2022-08-22)
======================

Breaking Changes
----------------

- In `saltfactories.utils.cli_scipts.generate_script()`:

  * For coverage tracking, both `coverate_db_path` and `coverage_rc_path` must be passed. They will not be infered by `root_dir`.
  * `inject_coverage` was removed. (`#135 <https://github.com/saltstack/pytest-salt-factories/issues/135>`_)
- The minimum Salt version in now `3004` (`#136 <https://github.com/saltstack/pytest-salt-factories/issues/136>`_)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- CI and internal changes:

  * Start testing Salt 3005.x (rc2 for now)

1.0.0rc18 (2022-07-14)
======================

Breaking Changes
----------------

- Renamed the ``system_install`` configuration flag, markers and behaviours when set to ``system_service`` to better reflect what it's actually used for. (`#96 <https://github.com/saltstack/pytest-salt-factories/issues/96>`_)


Features
--------

- Allow passing ``--python-executable`` to teak which python get's used to prefix CLI commands, when needed. (`#129 <https://github.com/saltstack/pytest-salt-factories/issues/129>`_)
- Allow passing ``--scripts-dir`` to tell salt-factories where to look for the Salt daemon and CLI scripts.
  The several scripts to the Salt daemons and CLI's **must** exist. Also, passing this option will additionally make
  salt-factories **NOT** generate said scripts and set ``python_executable`` to ``None`` (`#130 <https://github.com/saltstack/pytest-salt-factories/issues/130>`_)
- Added CLI support(``--system-service``) to change salt-factories to use Salt previously installed from the platform's package manager. (`#131 <https://github.com/saltstack/pytest-salt-factories/issues/131>`_)
- Inject ``engines_dirs`` and ``log_handlers_dirs`` when ``system_service=True`` or ``scripts_path`` is not ``None``
  These flags suggest that the salt being imported and used by salt-factories might not be the same as the one being tested.
  So, in this case, make sure events and logging from started daemons still get forwarded to salt-factories. (`#133 <https://github.com/saltstack/pytest-salt-factories/issues/133>`_)


1.0.0rc17 (2022-06-17)
======================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Bump deprecations targeted for 2.0.0 to 3.0.0 (`#122 <https://github.com/saltstack/pytest-salt-factories/issues/122>`_)
- Try to pass ``loaded_base_name`` to each of Salt's loaders used in our ``Loaders`` class, if not supported, patch it at runtime. (`#126 <https://github.com/saltstack/pytest-salt-factories/issues/126>`_)
- ``saltfactories.utils.warn_until()`` is now aware of Pytest's rewrite calls and properly reports the offending code. (`#127 <https://github.com/saltstack/pytest-salt-factories/issues/127>`_)


1.0.0rc16 (2022-05-28)
======================

Improvements
------------

- Switch to internal start check ``callables``.

  Additionally, significant container improvements, like:

  * Get host ports to check from the container port bindings.
  * Always terminate the containers.
  * Support randomly assigned host port bindings

  ``skip_on_salt_system_install`` is now also a marker provided by ``pytest-salt-factories``. (`#120 <https://github.com/saltstack/pytest-salt-factories/issues/120>`_)


1.0.0rc15 (2022-05-09)
======================

Bug Fixes
---------

- ``--timeout`` is now correctly passed for CLI factories when either ``timeout`` is defined on the configuration or when ``timeout`` is passed to the CLI factory constructor. (`#117 <https://github.com/saltstack/pytest-salt-factories/issues/117>`_)


Trivial/Internal Changes

  * Salt allows minions and proxy minions to also have file and pillar roots configured
  * All factories will now send logs of level ``debug`` or higher to the log server (`#49 <https://github.com/saltstack/pytest-salt-factories/issues/49>`_)
- Log the test outcome (`#52 <https://github.com/saltstack/pytest-salt-factories/issues/52>`_)
